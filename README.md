### I code, I write, I game, I do math, I do physics, I try to cycle, I try to drive, I try to fly, I try to tank, I try to read. So at the end I do nothing.

Computers are easier than humans. You tell them what they do, and they do exactly what you told them to. Just that sometimes it's not in the way you will expect.

The most satisfying feeling is when your CP submission passes with all Green ACs.

Coding is fun when it works, coding is pain when it works, **against** you. So coding is just like life.
